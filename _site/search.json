Click on “Processing” → “Toolbox” → Select “Join Attributes by Location (Summary)” → Set  “Join to features in” as “MP19SZ” → Set “By comparing to” as “EV_Points” → Select “Intersect, Contain, Are Within” for the features → Select “Count” for summaries to calculate→ Run \n3. Right Click on this new joined layer → “Export” → “save Features As” → Save it as a GeoPackage named GP and save the layer as “EV_Points_Choropleth” \n4. Right click on this layer → Select “Properties” → Click on “Symbology” → Choose Graduated style → Set Value as “No. of Charging Outlets Count” → Select Natural Breaks (Jenks) for classification → Click Classify → Apply\n\n\n1.2 Areas lacking EV Charging Points\n\n\n1. Load MP19 \n2. Right click on MP19 → “Open Attribute Table” → “Select by Expression” → Write this in the expression:  “Description” LIKE ‘%COMMERCIAL%’ OR “Description” LIKE ‘%RESIDENTIAL%’ → “Select Features” \n3.

    "text": "Singapore’s energy grid, heavily reliant on natural gas, faces increasing pressure from rising electric vehicle (EV) adoption. With limited land, there is a need to identify optimal sites for solar-powered EV charging stations that integrate solar energy harvesting and storage to reduce dependence on the grid and support Green Plan 2030 goals.\n\n\n\nWe propose a GIS-based multi-criteria analysis to assess land suitability for solar-powered EV charging stations. By analysing factors like solar potential, land availability, and EV demand, we aim to identify ideal locations for these stations. This solution aims to support Singapore’s target of 60,000 charging points by 203 and leverages solar storage technologies (e.g. lithium-ion batteries) to ensure efficient operation, contributing to sustainable mobility and decarbonisation under the Green Plan 2030"
