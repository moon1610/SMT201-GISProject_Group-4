Through this GIS-based exploration of solar potential for EV charging integration in Singapore, our team gained valuable insights across spatial analysis, energy systems, and urban planning realities:

-    We learnt how to leverage **multi-criteria GIS techniques** to overlay solar irradiance, terrain suitability, and infrastructure distribution for location-based decision-making.

-    The project highlighted the **gap between theoretical suitability and real-world implementation**, especially in space-scarce urban contexts.

-    Understanding Singapore’s regulatory and infrastructural limitations shaped our appreciation for **practical feasibility**, not just technical potential.

-    We gained hands-on experience with tools like **QGIS, raster calculators, zonal statistics, and spatial joins**, which helped us apply classroom concepts to a real-world use case.

## Limitations & Real-World Challenges

Despite the value of spatial analysis, several real-world constraints must be acknowledged:

### Technical & Transparency Barriers

-   **Lack of Transparency**: EV station operators rarely disclose whether sites are grid-tied or off-grid.

<!-- -->

-    **Dynamic Landscape**: With over **1,129 new charging points** added in the last six months (as of Jan 2025), data becomes outdated quickly, especially for experimental or private off-grid setups

### Urban Infrastructure Constraints

-   **Space Scarcity**: Rooftop or open-air installations are limited by Singapore’s land constraints and competing usage priorities (e.g., parking).

<!-- -->

-    **High Upfront Costs**: A 50 kWp solar canopy system can cost **\$100,000–\$200,000 SGD**, factoring in structure, labor, and urban integration.

<!-- -->

-   **Energy Mismatch**: Solar output peaks in the daytime, while EV charging may occur at night—requiring grid backup or **battery storage** (\~\$25,000–\$50,000 SGD per 50 kWh).

### Regulatory & Structural Considerations

-    **Approval Complexity**: Deployments require regulatory compliance across **LTA, EMA, and HDB**, including standards like **TR25** and grid interconnection.

-    **Structural Load & Weather**: Solar infrastructure must be engineered to withstand **heavy rainfall and wind**, increasing design and material costs.
